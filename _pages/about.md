Hey! My name is Donghui Li, a Ph.D. student at Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm currently working with my advisor Dr. Ximing Cai on water resources system analysis, data-driven reservoir operation modeling and its implementation with hydrological simulations, and coupled hydro-human drought events. Please check out my [CV](/cv/) here.
