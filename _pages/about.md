Hey! My name is Donghui Li. I am a Ph.D. student at Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm interested in understanding the hydrological extremes and their interaction with socioeconomic activities using interdisciplinary approaches. I've been working with my advisor [Dr. Ximing Cai](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/xmcai) on generic reservoir operation modeling, data-driven reservoir operation modeling and its implementation with hydrological simulations, and coupled hydro-socioeconomic drought events. Please check out my [CV](/cv/) here.

> ### News
> - [2023-05] I will be presenting at the upcoming EWRI on data-driven reservoir operation modeling and operation patterns: "Operation rules and patterns for 450+ large reservoirs in the Contiguous United States". Hope to chat with you!
>
> - [2023-02] I will be presenting a poster at the USACE R & D Day on our open dataset of empirically derived operation rules for 450+ large reservoirs across the CONUS. Check out the dataset [here](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/63add4d5826a4b21a6546c571bdece10/).

> - [2022-09] We published an open dataset on HydroShare: ["Data-driven Reservoir Operation Rules for 450+ Reservoirs in Contiguous United States"](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/63add4d5826a4b21a6546c571bdece10/). The operation rules are extracted with our [Generic Data-driven Reservoir Operation Model (GDROM)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.104274) and converted to "if-then" statements for easy implementation.

> - [2022-07] My co-first authored paper, ["Developing a generic data-driven reservoir operation model
"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.104274), has been published on _Advanced in Water Resources_. It shows a novel data-driven reservoir operation model based on hidden Markov assumption and decision tree model.
