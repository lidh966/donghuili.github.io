This project couples hidden Markov model and decision tree model to simulate daily release policy for large reservoirs. The operation rule of any reservoir is assumed to consist of a small number of representative operation modules, which are assumed to follow the Markov process, and decoded with hidden Markov model. Each module is modeled with decision tree model. The module application condition, i.e., which module to apply under a specific hydroclimatic condition, is also modeled with the decision tree model.
