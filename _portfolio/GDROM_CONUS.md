This project applies our generic data-driven reservoir operation model (GDROM) ([check our paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.104274)) to 450+ large reservoirs across the CONUS. Daily release policies are empirically derived for each reservoir, and insights are obtained to understand historical operation patterns.
